# Assignment 2

This folder contains three compiler passes solving Assignment 2 of CS5544

## available Pass

This pass performs available expression analysis on the program and prints it.
The generated pass is `available.so`

## liveness Pass

This pass performs liveness analysis analysis on the program and prints it.
The generated pass is `liveness.so`

## reaching Pass

This pass performs reaching definition analysis on the program and prints it.
The generated pass is `reaching.so`

To build all three passes

```bash
cd ./Dataflow
make
```

This generates the function pass in the form of shared library `LocalOpts.so`
## Tests

The tests folder contains four test programs for the passes.
- available-test-m2r.bc (test for available pass)
- reaching-test-m2r.bc (test for reaching pass)
- liveness-test-m2r.bc (test for liveness pass)

Every folder has a Makefile which generate the optimized LLVM IR in the filename `out.ll`
To run any test

```bash
cd ./tests
opt -load ../Dataflow/<passname>.so -<passname> <testfile> -o out
```
